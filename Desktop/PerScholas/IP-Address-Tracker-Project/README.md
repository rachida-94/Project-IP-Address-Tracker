I started this project using the provided starter files and created my Project structure . First, I styled the page content using Tailwind CSS to keep the layout clean and responsive. As I read through the project instructions, I saw that Leaflet.js was mentioned, so I explored the documentation and realized I needed to install both Leaflet and React Leaflet to render the map.
To display the map, I used the MapContainer component from React Leaflet, which initializes the map and sets its default center and zoom level. Inside it, I added a TileLayer to load the map tiles from OpenStreetMap, giving the map its visual appearance. I also used the Marker component to place a pin on the map at the location returned by the IPify API, and wrapped it with a Popup to show a label when the marker is clicked.
To make the map dynamic, I used the useMap hook to access the Leaflet map instance. This allowed me to programmatically update the map’s center This allowed me to animate the map’s movement using map.flyTo([lat, lng], zoom) whenever new coordinates were fetched. I placed this logic inside a useEffect hook so the map would recenter automatically whenever the geolocation data changed.
