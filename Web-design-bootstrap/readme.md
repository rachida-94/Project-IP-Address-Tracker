The design I aimed to achieve is the Testimonial Grid Section from Frontend Mentor. https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7

First, I created five cards using Bootstrap. I assigned the first card 6 columns, while the second and third cards each received 3 columns.
I encountered alignment issues, preventing the cards from sitting next to each other properly. Mr. Bryan helped me resolve that problem. However, I also wanted to push the other two cards to the top and have the third card share the second row with another card. Unfortunately, I couldn't achieve this using Bootstrap.
